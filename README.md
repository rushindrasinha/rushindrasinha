## What I'm Building

**[Global Esports](https://globalesports.gg)** — Operating Asia's premier esports org across Valorant, CS, and more. VCT Pacific partner.

**[clawdbot / OpenClaw](https://github.com/rushindrasinha/clawdbot)** — My personal AI operator (Ares). 24/7 persistent agent, WhatsApp-native, running on a Mac mini in Mumbai. Real-time task management, cron scheduling, browser automation, memory. Built on [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai).

**[clutch-creator](https://github.com/rushindrasinha/clutch-creator)** — Turn any webpage into a content idea in one click. Chrome extension powered by Claude. Built for esports creators and operators.

**[xReader.ai](https://xreaderai.lovable.app)** — Clean reading mode for X Articles and threads. Strip the noise, get the content. Dark/light mode, PDF export, 24-hour cache.

**[gefa.gg](https://gefa.gg)** — Custom Valorant esports intelligence dashboard. Live match tracking, news, transfers, org tracker, IST countdowns. Built because no tool gave me exactly what I needed as an esports operator.
